# hello-world
First GitHub project

Hello my name is Aaron and I am a student in web development. I am pursuing a career in Front End web development. Currently I am efficient in HTML and CSS and I know some JavaScript and jQuery. I am currently in my second to last semester and my goal is to be efficient in JavaScript, node.js, and other aspects of development by the summer 2018. By this time I would like to have all the criteria that makes me a well rounded front End developer that can confidently work and communicate between design, client, and server side web development.
